        <h1>Paraguay</h1>
        <p>Paraguay (/ˈpærəɡwaɪ/; Spanish pronunciation: [paɾaˈɣwai̯]; Guarani: Paraguái, [paɾaˈɣwaj]), officially
        the Republic of Paraguay (Spanish: República del Paraguay; Guarani: Tetã Paraguái), is a landlocked
        country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the
        east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River,
        which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South
        America, it is sometimes referred to as Corazón de Sudamérica ("Heart of South America").[7] Paraguay
        is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay
        is the smallest[8] landlocked country in the Americas.</p>
